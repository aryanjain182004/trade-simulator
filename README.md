1. Model Selection and Parameters
1.1 Slippage Calculation
Model: The slippage calculation uses a simple market order simulation model.
Parameters: Order quantity, order book data (asks and bids).
Rationale: This model estimates slippage by calculating the average execution price of a market order against the initial best bid price.
1.2 Almgren-Chriss Market Impact Model
Model: The Almgren-Chriss model is used to estimate market impact.
Parameters: Order quantity, volatility, temporary market impact coefficient (eta), permanent market impact coefficient (gamma), execution time horizon.
Rationale: This model is widely used in algorithmic trading to estimate the cost of executing large orders and to determine optimal execution strategies.
1.3 Maker/Taker Ratio Prediction
Model: A simplified logistic regression model is used to predict the maker/taker ratio.
Parameters: Order quantity, volatility.
Rationale: This model estimates the probability of an order being executed as a taker based on order characteristics.
2. Regression Techniques
2.1 Linear Regression (Slippage Estimation)
Implementation: The slippage estimation uses a linear regression model to estimate the relationship between order quantity and slippage.
Rationale: Linear regression is a simple and effective method for estimating this relationship.
2.2 Logistic Regression (Maker/Taker Ratio)
Implementation: The maker/taker ratio prediction uses a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of an order being executed as a taker.
Rationale: Logistic regression is suitable for predicting probabilities and works well with binary outcomes.
3. Market Impact Calculation Methodology
The market impact calculation uses the Almgren-Chriss model, which considers:
Temporary market impact (proportional to order quantity)
Permanent market impact (proportional to the square of order quantity)
Volatility's effect on market impact
The model is implemented as follows:
double CalculateMarketImpact(double orderQty, double volatility) {
    double eta = 0.01; // Temporary market impact coefficient
    double gamma = 0.0001; // Permanent market impact coefficient
    double timeHorizon = 1.0; // Execution time in seconds

    return eta * orderQty + gamma * orderQty * orderQty + volatility * sqrt(orderQty) / sqrt(timeHorizon);
}
4. Performance Optimization Approaches
4.1 Efficient Data Structures
Implementation: Using std::deque for order book history with size limits to prevent memory bloat.
Rationale: This allows for efficient addition and removal of elements while maintaining a limited history size.
4.2 Asynchronous WebSocket Operations
Implementation: Using async_read for non-blocking data reception.
Rationale: This prevents the application from being blocked by network operations and allows for concurrent processing.
4.3 Ping Mechanism
Implementation: Regular ping messages to maintain the WebSocket connection.
Rationale: This ensures the connection remains active and allows for detection of connection drops.
4.4 Threading Strategy
Implementation: Separate threads for WebSocket data reception, trade simulation, and UI rendering.
Rationale: This allows for concurrent execution of different tasks and improves overall application performance.
4.5 Code Optimization
Implementation: Using efficient algorithms and minimizing unnecessary computations.
Rationale: This reduces CPU usage and improves the application's responsiveness.
These optimizations ensure the application performs efficiently while maintaining accuracy in its calculations.
